rem for micropython

rem WARNING !!!! search for COMMAND PROMPT (not powershell) and run as admin
rem WARNING. edit cd to micropython project dir

: c:\Users\pboud\micropython\"MY MODULES"\create_sym_links.bat

: structure on windows:
: HOME/micropython
: HOME/Blynk


: sym link generic modules located in ../my modules (ie HOME/micropython/my modules) and ../../Blynk (ie HOME/Blynk)
: those are Windows directory
: HOME/Blynk also used for windows / python app - add to sys.path
: Home/Blynk also used on linux/raspberry


: WHY symlink for micropython ? 
: file needs to be in vscode project folder for pymakr upload (can be in any dir if this dir is included in sys.path of micropython script)
: edits when developping application will ACCUMULATE in a single (cross application) version. single version of "last version".
: WARNING: other application may need to be modified to adapt to the lastest version. necessary pain I guess

:creates sym link to Ã´oint to generic micropython modules
